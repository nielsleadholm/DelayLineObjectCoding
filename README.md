Purpose of the code
===============
The following implements a network of spiking neurons to explore the significance of delay-line computations for encoding object representations. In particular, the network is designed to explore the significance of such computations for robustness to both translations, as well as to the non-meaningful arrangement of features (in contrast to models based on pooling/bag-of-feature representations). 

The implementation makes use of the [Brian spiking neural network simulator](https://brian2.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
